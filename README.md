# product-landing-page
a basic product landing page to continue my FreeCodeCamp.org training

In this Project we are asked to come up with a Product landing page of our choice. I decided to create a Juggling ball product landing page to show off the impressive talent that is required to juggle and also where to find them!
It's a basic design just to continue my personal studies. Please take it with a grain of salt when reviewing, this is only my first public release of this code and design for FreeCodeCamp.
